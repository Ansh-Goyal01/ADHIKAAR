"""Rule-extraction pipeline: an LLM PROPOSES rules; humans decide what ships.

Given a scheme's official corpus text, the LLM drafts rules in the existing
YAML schema, each tagged with its exact source clause and URL. Drafts are
validated against the CLOSED UserProfile field vocabulary:

- drafts over known fields become engine-schema rules (review_status:
  proposed) written to app/rules/proposed/<scheme_id>.yaml — a directory the
  engine loader NEVER reads, so nothing goes live without human sign-off and
  an explicit move to app/rules/schemes/;
- drafts needing facts the profile can't express are quarantined as
  `blocked_rules` with the proposed new field named — adding a field is a
  schema + wizard + extraction-prompt change, a human decision.

Scheme: {scheme_name} ({scheme_id})
Official page: {page_url}

Official text (the ONLY source you may use):
\"\"\"{official_text}\"\"\"

Available profile fields — a rule may ONLY test these (exact names):
{vocabulary}

Write one rule per checkable criterion:
- kind: "require" (must hold) or "exclude" (must not hold — disqualifying conditions).
- id: short kebab-case (e.g. "age-at-least-18", "exclude-income-tax-payer").
- field / op ("eq","ne","gt","gte","lt","lte") / value. Use `any_of`/`all_of`
  with sub-conditions only when the text itself is an OR/AND of criteria.
- clause: the EXACT sentence(s) of official text the rule encodes — copy verbatim,
  never paraphrase, never merge distant sentences.
- ask: one kind plain-language question that would resolve the fact if unknown.
- self_declared: true only for facts the state ultimately verifies against its own
  lists (BPL list membership, SECC category) — the person can claim but not prove them
  in conversation.
Rules for numbers: transcribe thresholds exactly (18 stays 18; "Rs. 2.5 lakh" = 250000
yearly). If the text gives a monthly income limit, convert to yearly and note that in
notes_for_reviewer.

If a real criterion cannot be expressed with the available fields, put it in
blocked_rules with proposed_field (snake_case name + type + one-line meaning) instead
of forcing a wrong encoding.

If a criterion is real but too operational to model (state-specific notification,
enrollment windows, document formalities), list it in simplifications instead.

Output every checkable criterion from the text — do not invent criteria that are not
in the text, and do not skip exclusions.
