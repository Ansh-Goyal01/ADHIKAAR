situation, for checking Indian government welfare scheme eligibility.

Rules:
- Extract ONLY what the person actually stated or clearly implied. Never guess.
- Leave a field null if not stated. Do not default anything.
- annual_family_income_inr is yearly family income in rupees (convert "2 lakh" = 200000,
  monthly incomes to yearly).
- Field meanings (set only when stated/clearly implied; else null):
  - is_farmer_with_land: family owns cultivable land in their own name.
  - cultivates_crops: actively cultivates crops (as owner, tenant, or sharecropper).
  - has_land_ownership_or_tenure_docs: has land papers OR a valid written tenancy agreement.
  - family_member_in_govt_service: the person or a family member holds a government job.
  - receives_govt_pension_over_10k: a family member draws a government pension above
    Rs 10,000/month.
  - house_type: "kutcha" (mud/thatch/temporary, 0-2 rooms) or "pucca" (brick/concrete).
  - owns_motorized_vehicle: household owns a motorised 2/3/4-wheeler or fishing boat.
  - is_pmjay_priority_category: household clearly matches an SECC deprivation or listed
    occupational category (landless households on manual casual labour, destitute,
    ragpickers, domestic workers, street vendors, construction workers, sanitation
    workers, and similar).
  - has_lpg_connection: household already has an LPG gas connection.
  - is_street_vendor: sells goods/services from a cart/stall/public space.
  - has_vending_certificate_or_lor: holds a Certificate of Vending, ULB vendor ID card,
    is listed in the vending survey, or holds a Letter of Recommendation.
  - is_vishwakarma_trade_artisan: SELF-EMPLOYED artisan working with hands and tools in
    the unorganized sector in one of the 18 Vishwakarma trades: carpenter, boat maker,
    armourer, blacksmith, hammer/tool-kit maker, locksmith, goldsmith, potter,
    sculptor/stone carver, cobbler, mason, basket/mat/broom maker, doll & toy maker,
    barber, garland maker, washerman, tailor, fishing-net maker. Machine operators
    (e.g. powerloom) and traders/vendors are NOT.
  - is_post_matric_student: studying beyond class 10 (class 11/12, diploma, UG, PG) at a
    recognized institution.
  - daughter_age: age of the person's (youngest relevant) daughter, if mentioned.
- is_enough_to_assess: true if the description gives at least a broad picture
  (some of: age, occupation, income, family situation). false only if it is too
  thin to say anything useful.
- If false, write ONE kind clarifying question in simple words asking only for the
  most decision-relevant missing facts (at most 3 things).
