"""R4 — detect common document types in a scheme's documents markdown.

Detection runs on the English corpus text before edge-translation (the
frontend only ever sees translated markdown, so it cannot match reliably).
The emitted keys are language-invariant; the frontend owns the localized
guide content (where to get each document, typical cost, typical time).
